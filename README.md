# Blockchain-Based Voting System

## Overview

This project is a blockchain-based voting system designed to provide secure, transparent, and tamper-proof electronic voting. Leveraging the power of blockchain technology, our system ensures that every vote is recorded immutably and can be independently verified, fostering trust and integrity in the electoral process.

## Features

- **Immutable Ledger:** All votes are stored on a blockchain, making them tamper-proof and easily auditable.
- **Transparency:** The voting process is transparent, and results can be verified by anyone without compromising voter anonymity.
- **Security:** Utilizes cryptographic techniques to ensure the privacy and security of votes.
- **Accessibility:** Voters can participate from anywhere, increasing accessibility and convenience.

## Technologies Used

- Blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Hyperledger, or other)
- Smart Contracts
- Web3.js / Ethers.js
- Frontend: React.js / Angular / Vue.js
- Backend: Node.js / Express.js

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain-voting-system.git
   cd blockchain-voting-system
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Setup Blockchain Environment:**
   - Configure your local blockchain (e.g., Ganache) or connect to a testnet.
   - Update the smart contract configuration in the project.

4. **Deploy Smart Contracts:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
   ```

5. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

- Register as a voter (if registration is required by the system).
- Login and participate in the voting process.
- View real-time results and verify the transparency of the election process.
